## Queries 

### CTA Buttons
Do we have another idea about the buttons? Are we not ok with the CTA button in the PR as suggested by the comments in the end user page?

### HTML Button
Can we add HTML buttons, I have few options to show you,
In that case, can we add the styles in Project repo in CSS or SCSS folders. can you suggest me?

I like that you used an icon there. I think it would be cool to use an icon also in the button. Perhaps it could be Slack icon instead, since it should lead to Slack, instead of CNCF icon. What do you think?
Yes, I will look for Slack icon and try to integrate.

### Carousel for surveys 
I have a sample, but still in progress:
Similar to the HTML button, we need to add styles and .html files in respective folders:
Styles ---> css/scss
..htmk ---> _includes folder in project repo root
